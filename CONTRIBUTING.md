# Contributing to Slipstream Rust SDK

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute!

## Development Setup

1.  Use `cargo` to build and test.
2.  Run `cargo test` to execute the test suite (unit and integration tests).
3.  Ensure code is formatted with `cargo fmt`.

## Pull Request Process

1.  Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2.  Add tests for any new functionality.
3.  Ensure the test suite passes.
4.  Update the documentation.
5.  Sign your commits (DCO).

## Code Style

We follow standard Rust idioms and `rustfmt` defaults.
